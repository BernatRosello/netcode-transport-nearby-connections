  "version": "1.1.0",

  "description": "This package implemented the transport layer of Netcode for GameObjects with Apple Multipeer Connectivity, which can enable peer-to-peer communication between nearby devices.\n\nBy using Multipeer Connectivity, nearby devices can connect to each other when there is no WiFi or cellular network. Multipeer Connectivity is the technology behind AirDrop, which means it can transfer large file between devices very fast.\n\nPlease reference Apple's official document for detailed information: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity.",
